Description: Visualization of antibody titer scores is valuable for examination of vaccination 
    effects and usefulness of the antibody used for titer scoring. 'AntibodyTiters' visualizes 
    antibody titers of all or selected patients. This package also produces empty excel files 
    in a specified format, in which users can fill in experimental data for visualization. 
    Excel files with toy data can also be produced, so that users can see how it is visualized
    before obtaining real data. The data should contain titer scores at pre-vaccination, after-
    1st shot, after-2nd shot, and at least one additional sampling point. Patients with 
    missing values can be included. The first three sampling points will be plotted discretely, 
    whereas those following the after-2nd shot will be plotted on a continuous time scale 
    starting from the day of second shot.
